# Toxic-Comment
Discussing things you care about can be difficult. The threat of abuse and harassment online means that many people stop expressing themselves and give up on seeking different opinions. Platforms struggle to effectively facilitate conversations, leading many communities to limit or completely shut down user comments.

In this project focus is on building machine learning models that are capable of detecting toxic comments. 

The dataset was obtained from Kaggle Toxic Comment competition and it's a collection of comments from Wikipediaâ€™s talk page edits.
